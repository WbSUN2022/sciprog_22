! This program is to read a matrix from a file, and decide if it is a magic-square matrix
!
! Three files are required in compilation:
!    magic_square.f90, file_read.f90, main.f90
!
! Build command:
! $ gfortran -o magicSquare magic_square.f90 file_read.f90 main.f90
!
! Before executing the program, the file with a matrix has to be prepared.
! For example, a sample file with its name "matrix.txt" and the stored matrix in it
! 1  1
! 1  1
!
! Run command:
! $ ./magicSquare
! user will be asked to enter the name of the file where the matrix is stored,
! then the program will read in the matrix from the file and decide if the matrix is a magicsquare one
! 
! the read-in matrix will be printed on screen for improved visibility
